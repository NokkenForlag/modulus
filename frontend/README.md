# Modulus Frontend

This directory contains the static frontend for the Modulus project, served by Render. It handles login routing, role storage, and access testing in coordination with Webflow and Feide.

## üìÅ File Overview

These files are used for integration with Webflow and testing authentication.

## üîê Authentication Flow

- `auth.html` serves as the entry point for all unauthenticated users.
- After Feide login, users are redirected to `auth-bridge.html` with the `feide_role` included in the query string.
- `auth-bridge.html` stores the role in `localStorage` and redirects the user to a Webflow page.
- Webflow pages can use JavaScript and `data-role` attributes to conditionally display content based on the stored role.

## üß™ Testing

- Use `test-rollevisning.html` to verify the role currently stored in `localStorage`.
- Helpful for validating access rules and debugging role-based content visibility.
